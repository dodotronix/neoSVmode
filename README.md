# Neoverilog

Unfold portmaps and generated required variables in SV. 

## What Is neoSVmode
This supposed to be a neovim plugin to provide the funcitonalities of
emacs verilog plugin. The first goal of the project, is to be able to
unfold the port maps of the module instances with \.\* auto connection.
It should be compatible with emacs, because many digital designes use it 
just with the verilog-mode plugin.
