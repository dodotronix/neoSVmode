# Neoverilog
This supposed to be a neovim plugin to provide the funcitonalities of
emacs verilog plugin. The first goal of the project, is to be able to
unfold the port maps of the module instances with \.\* auto connection.
It should be compatible with emacs, because many digital designes use it 
just with the verilog-mode plugin. 

## Current status
The project just started, so it is not yet ready to use. I am actualy trying to
get the first basic functionality running, to be able to switch to my neovim
workflow even at work, where i am forced to use emacs with evil-mode (which
feels just wrong for me :D). So the motivation is huge, which helps to get
closer to desired results.
